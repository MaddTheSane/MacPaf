Current known issues in MAF:

* Searching/Sorting/Filtering uses naive algorithms so is slow and inefficient (both time and memory)
* Lots of empty XML tags are created that are not necessary
* Need unit tests for domain layer
* Need to make sure all data from a GEDCOM import is maintained during editing, even if not exposed through the UI
* Loading an existing file is currently treated as an import, so slow and inefficient
* UUIDs not quite working correctly, especially for Families
* Need to make sure that custom GEDCOM tags survive a GEDCOM import/export cycle
