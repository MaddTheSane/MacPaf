MAF Overview

MAF is a genealogy/family history application for the Macintosh. It is designed to help people record and organize information
about their families. It is designed specifically to be useful to the LDS community, though at some time it may be possible
to disable the LDS-specific functionality.

MAF is an NSDocument-based Cocoa application. Currently most of the implementation is written in Java using the Cocoa-Java
bridge, but since the Cocoa-Java bridge has been deprecated and will likely not exist in 10.6, plans are to migrate to
Objective-C or Ruby.

MAF is designed to be familiar and comfortable to use for previous users of the old PAF for Mac (Family Records) 2.3.1
application written by the LDS Church, which is no longer maintained and does not run on the latest Macintoshes.

MAF currently uses the GEDCOM data model as it's primary data model. Initially it will support versions 5.5 and 5.5.1, though
support for older versions may be added if requested. MAF will not initially expose all of the functionality present
in GEDCOM, but should not lose any data it doesn't know how to deal with, including custom GEDCOM tags.
