MAF Domain Design Document

I have been thinking about using some principles from Domain Driven Design, by Eric Evans.
Entities have identity and have a single canonical representation.
Value Objects are immutable and disposable

Entities:
	Individual
		An individual represents a person and is involved in relationships with other individuals.
		They have several IDs, at least one must be unique
		
	
	Family
		A family represents a couple and their children. MAF currently uses the GEDCOM model of families
		which assumes an optional male father and an optional female mother with zero or more children.
		Each family has a unique ID.

	Place
		I'm not sure if these should be entities yet, but I would like a master list of places with
		some sort of identity so they can be distinguished and correlated.

Value Objects:
	Date
		Represents a specific moment in time, or a range of time. May have several alternate representations
		Will have a normalized form that can be formatted to various locales and display formats.
	
	Event
		Has a date and a place
	
	Fact
		Describes some attribute or information known about an individual or family.
		May have a date due to some inconsistencies in GEDCOM and other data differences.
